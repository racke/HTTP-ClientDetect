NAME
    HTTP::ClientDetect - Detect language and location of an HTTP request

VERSION
    Version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
      use HTTP::ClientDetect::Location;
      my $geo = HTTP::ClientDetect::Location->new(db => $dbfile);
      my $country = $geo->request_country($request_object)

      use HTTP::ClientDetect::Language;
      my $lang_detect = HTTP::ClientDetect::Language->new(server_default => "hr_HR");
      my $lang = $lang_detect->language_short($request_object);

DESCRIPTION
    This module by itself doesn't do nothing. You have to load one or more
    of its children, as per synopsis.

    The object passed to the methods has to be an object which at least has
    an `header' method for the language detection, or `address' or
    `remote_address' for the country detection. This should work with
    Dancer::Request and Catalyst::Request objects.
